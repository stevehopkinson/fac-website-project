LM: I got the following tips from my FAC mentor, Noga Inbar:
- Intro to API's- https://zapier.com/learn/apis/chapter-1-introduction-to-apis/

- General Assembly has a [free online resource](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/projects) which fun and builds basic things but gives you an idea of how html, css, and js interact (note though that they use jquery)

- Comprehensive book on DOM manipulation by Jeremy Keith called [DOM scripting](http://solmazakademi.com/media/academy_pdf/DOM_Scripting_Web_Design_with_JavaScript_and_the_Document_Object_Model_In1UMhl.pdf)
