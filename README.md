- Learn to work with APIs
- Develop portfolio
- Documenting our journey as a resource for the next intake

## Resources

- codepen.io - As above
- balsamiq.com - Wireframe/prototype builder
- https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/writing-user-stories - Gov.uk guide to writing user stories
- http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/userStory.htm - Another user stories tutorial (beware of jargon!)
- https://www.atlassian.com/agile/requirements - Guide to writing requirements
- http://www.pjsrivastava.com/articles/a-short-guide-to-writing-software-requirements - Another requirements guide
- http://www.trello.com - Good collaborative tool to keep track of tasks and what stage they're at ([see an example board][1])

## First steps

- Pair off and divide up tasks
- Write a list of all the things the website needs to do
- Work up ideas into user stories
- Develop a wireframe from that list
- Build an HTML skeleton of the page - no styling or JavaScript unless it's necessary 
- Develop richer functionality (adaptive designs/animations/forms/clever stuff)

## Week 1 tasks

- Create a list of things that your website will do (eg. allow people to RSVP, show map, etc)
- Create a wireframe using balsamiq or similar to show what your website might look like
- (If possible) Create a basic HTML skeleton of the page
